# Operon
- a group of related [[gene | genes]] common in prokaryotic genomes
	-  e.g.1.  *Escherichia coli's* lac operon.
- encode a single enzyme protein
	-  e.g.1. lac operon codes for $\beta$-galactosidase enzyme that digests dissacharide lactose into monosacharides glucose and galactose which are smaller, more favorable as an energy and carbon source than the lactose.  
- consists of sequence regions: promoter, operator, related genes, etc.

## Promoter
- regulatory DNA sequence.
- recognition(?) and binding site for [[RNA polymerase]] which then transcribes the genes in an operon. 

## Operator
- repressive DNA sequence.
- recognition and binding site for the repressor enzyme (?)

 # Lactose Operon

The lactose operon (also known as the lac operon) is a set of genes that are specific for uptake and metabolism of lactose and is found in E. coli and other bacteria.
