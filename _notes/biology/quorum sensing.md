Single-celled [[prokaryote|prokaryotes]] can act like multicellular eukaryotes through cell communication strategies (quorum sensing) that are carried out simultaneously by a large number of prokaryotic cells. Interestingly, bacteria with mutations in a quorum sensing gene can accelerate disease when they infect susceptible cystic fibrosis patients.

bacterial quorum sensing - cell-to-cell bacterial communication mechanism/process among the same or different species by the production and sensing of the local concentrations of [[autoinducer|autoinducers]] to regulate [[gene expression]](e.g. production of enzymes or virulence factors). 

[[bacterium|Bacteria]] interact with same or different bacterial species, or their host through autoinducters. 

QS-regulated processes: [[aggregation]], [[biofilm]] formation, [[bioluminescence]], [[sporulation]],

Goals of QS research:
- elucidate the mechanisms regulating QS process.

The flashlight fish has an organ under its eye that emits light,  
which serves to startle predators and attract prey, and allows  
the fish to communicate with other fish. Some species can  
rotate the organ inside and then out, so the light appears to  
flash on and off. The light is actually emitted by bacteria (of the  
genus Vibrio) that live in the organ in a mutualistic relationship  
with the fish. (The bacteria receive nutrients from the fish.)  
The bacteria must multiply until they reach a certain density  
in the organ (a “quorum”; see Concept 11.1), at which point  
they all begin emitting light at the same time. There is a group  
of six or so genes, called lux genes, whose gene products are  
necessary for light formation. Given that these bacterial genes  
are regulated together, propose a hypothesis for how the genes  
are organized and regulated. ch. 18

Many bacteria, for example, respond to chemical signals that are secreted by their  
neighbors and accumulate at higher population density. This process, called quorum sensing, allows bacteria to coordinate their behavior, including their motility,  
antibiotic production, spore formation, and sexual conjugation.
